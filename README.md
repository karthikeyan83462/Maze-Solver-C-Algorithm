# Maze Solver in C

This repository contains C code for generating and solving mazes using a backtracking algorithm. It provides functionalities to visualize the maze generation process, display binary representation, and animate the maze-solving process.

## Features

- Maze generation with visualization
- Binary representation of the maze
- Graphic animation of the maze-solving process
